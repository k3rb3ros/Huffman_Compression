#DONE# Make charTable and Sort table accessable to Trie class through inheritance
#DONE# Write insert into Trie function that inserts sorted characters and their occurences into the Trie
#DONE# Write recursive count function that gets the sumation of the character counts of all the children of a node passed into it
* Modify the encode function so that it can extend beyond the 64 bit limit for long encodings
* Write an gen_encode function that loops through the buffered message and uses the encode table to write out the encoding to a buffer
* Write a gen header function that puts all necessary information in a buffer to be written to the file
* Write an encode function that writes the header and the huffman code to file and renames the file *.mcp
* Write a decode function that reads the header into ram generates a lookup table and then using a 1 to 1 lookup operation  replaces the encoded text with the original text, then writes it to file and then changes the file name back to original
* Write a get_comp_ratio function that prints out the length of the original and compressed files along with the compression ratio
* Add functionality for main to take command line arguements (flags) that will dicatate how the program runs
